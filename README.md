# Prediction-of-Water-Quality-parameters-of-Ulsoor-Lake

Water is one of the precious natural resources present
on earth. Water quality prediction is an important challenge for
researchers. The increasing intervention of human activities has
led to the deterioration of water quality of different water bodies,
causing threat to the aquatic creatures. This paper aims at
predicting the values of different parameters that are used to
determine the water quality of the lake by comparing seven
algorithms namely BPNN, SVR, SRN, LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM and
Improved RNN, calculating the Water Quality Index using
weighted arithmetic water quality index (WAWQI) method and
suggesting methodologies to improve the water quality. The
models are evaluated using 3 evaluation metrices namely RMSE,
MAE and MAPE. The data from Ulsoor lake, Bengaluru,
Karnataka, India is used to verify the proposed model.
